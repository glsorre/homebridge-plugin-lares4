# Description

The purpose of this project is to offer to the community a homebridge plugin to expose Ksenia Lares 4 home automation systems on the apple ecosystem.

# Status

The current status is definitely WIP. Basic entities like lights, covers, domus expansion module should be manageable.

# Tech stack

The package is very minimal it is based on my own lib [lares4-ts](https://github.com/glsorre/lares4-ts).

# Design

I followed the following principles developing the plugin:

1. to not mess with your alarm and will manage only home automation entities (sensors, lights, covers, etc.);
2. to respect ksenia lares 4 entities logic as much as possible.

# Roadmap

- [X] Publish on github;
- [X] Publish on npmjs;
- [X] Testing phase;
- [ ] Documentation;
- [ ] Cover entire ksenia ecosystem.
